Projecto

Dataset: A version of the "thyroid0387" Dataset: proj-data.csv

## **Objectives:**

### **O1.**

Students should provide the best possible classification models using whatever method covered in class [Remember: within each model, everything else being similar, the simplest configurations should be preferred]
Classification should be according to 8 classes of the target variable "diagnoses": 6 indicated at the end of data.names the class '-', corresponding to no condition, and other diagnoses.

### **O2.**

Can we confidently predict the age of the subject given the other attributes?
Can we confidently predict the sex of the subject given the other attributes?

### **O3.**

What are the most significant features in the best models obtained above (in O1 and O2)?

Processing notes

See information on data in data.names
Your notebook should be prepared to test the models with the independent test set.  Failling to do so, will significantly penalise the project.  Mock-ups of test data files are available for the effect, eg. proj-test-data.csv and project-test-class.csv.

## **Evaluation**
    
The work will be evaluated taking into account:
the description of the steps taken to achieve the objectives
the implementation according to the mentioned description
the evaluation of the best models performance obtained in an independent test set
an individual quizz test on the developed project, hands on in the lab computer


## **Submission**

Students should submit a ZIP file (no other compression algorithms allowed) with 2 documents

PDF - Report with 6 pages MAXIMUM [aprox. 3000 words], containing
    Header:
        Group number
        Student names and ids
        how many hours each student contributed to the project
    Report text
        Introduction and Goals - brief description of the task, data and goals.
        Data processing - Briefly describe all data processing steps
        Variable selection - Describe the approach followed for variable selection
        Model results - should include a table with the statistics for the best models tested
        Hyperparameter tuning - briefly describe which parameters were tuned and how
        Discussion and Conclusions
    all sections can be supported by graphics
    
Jupyter Notebook with the source code and attached results that led to the report. This Notebook with outputs should never be larger than 12 pages [penalties will be applied]
